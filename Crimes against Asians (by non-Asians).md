# Hate crimes against Asians (by non-Asians)

A "hate crime" describes a criminal act committed in whole, or in part, because of the victim's actual or perceived race or ethnicity. The bias need not be the only motivation. Hateful words, or epithets, are not required.

- On Jun 19, 1982 [Vincent Chin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Vincent_Chin) was beaten to death in a racially motivated attack by Chrysler plant supervisor Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz in Detroit, MI. They assumed Chin was of Japanese descent and blamed him for the success of Japan's auto industry, despite the fact that Chin was of Chinese descent. Ebens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but bargained the charges down to manslaughter and pleaded guilty in 1983. They were ordered to pay $3,000 and serve three years' probation, with no jail time. The lenient sentence led to a vocal outcry from Asian Americans.
