#Hate crimes against Asians (by non-Asians)
A "hate crime" describes a criminal act committed in whole, or in part, because of the victim's actual or perceived race or ethnicity. The bias need not be the only motivation. Hateful words, or epithets, are not required.

- On Jun 19, 1982 Vincent Chin was beaten to death in a racially motivated attack by Chrysler plant supervisor Ronald Ebens and his stepson, Michael Nitz. They assumed Chin was of Japanese descent and are alleged to have used racial slurs as they attacked him. Ebens and Nitz blamed him for the success of Japan's auto industry, despite the fact that Chin was of Chinese descent. Ebens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but bargained the charges down to manslaughter and pleaded guilty in 1983. They were ordered to pay $3,000 and serve three years' probation, with no jail time. While Ebens and Nitz never denied the brawl, they claimed the fight was not racially motivated and said they did not use racial epithets.[5] The lenient sentence led to a vocal outcry from Asian Americans. The president of the Detroit Chinese Welfare Council said it amounted to a "$3,000 license to kill" Chinese Americans. As a result, the case has been viewed as a critical turning point for Asian American civil rights engagement and a rallying cry for stronger federal hate crime legislation.
